<h1>About</h1>
<hr>

<p>Hi, there! <br><br>

    My name is <a href="https://hauqxngo.com/" target="_blank">Hau</a>. I created this app in order to help cooking and planning meals easier as it appears in a form of a to-do list, instead, you have a to-cook list. <br><br>

    After having a baby, and the little one grows into a toddler who needs her food to be varied, I have the need to plan things out every single day. I was actually doing this manually by writing on a board on my fridge every time I'm thinking about what I want to cook next. <br><br>
    <!-- Also, the purpose is to avoid spoiled fresh vegetables or leftovers that could be forgotten in the back of the fridge. However, I didn't have the luxury of getting a random recipe to add to my list like <a href="#">this</a>. -->

    I hope you found this helpful. If you have any feedback, please reach out at hauqxngo@gmail.com. <hr>
    
    Thanks for visiting and have a great day!
</p>
