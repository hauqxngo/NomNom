## About
This is my first Capstone Project at Springboard Bootcamp. This app is to help users get a quick and random recipe to cook for their next meal or plan their weekly menu in a to-cook list.

## Features
### Navigation bar
- Navigation bar is visible on the top of each pages. It is responsive and will adapt to different devices.
- Navigation scheme:
  - On the left side is the site's logo. It can also be used to navigate to the Homepage.
  - On the right side is the collapse burger menu. It contains 4 pages if not registed:
    - Home
    - About
    - Login
    - Sign Up
  - After registered and logged in, there will be 5 pages on the navigation bar:
    - Home
